# Three-body problem

A simulation of a physics problem that involves 3 bodies that have an initial position and velocity, the bodies are equally attracted to each other related to the distance between the bodies. the simulation is to solve the positions, velocity and acceleration of the bodies. 

## Software Anaylse 
I have chosen to develop the project in Javascript because I have pre-existing libraries made specifically to work with Vectors and vectoroperations.

I also can look at other examples about physics and gravity, therefore making it easier to get started on the project.

I have not chosen for Unity because I wanted to quickly get started, and be able to quickly test new changes made in the program. Unity takes a long time to compile (on my laptop) and uses a lot more space and processing power. JS is quick to test and low on processing power.

I did not have the necessary skills required to develop this project in any other engine before the deadline.
## Leerdoelen 
- Making a gravity model
- Making a simulation
- Using THREE.js to develop a 3D version of the simulation

## Planning 
| | monday | tuesday | wednesday | thursday | friday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|week 1 | Github repository and briefing | Research about the best engine/language to develop | Make Object of the bodies and apply logic | Make the bodies interact with each other | Refine the gravity model |
|week 2 | Refine the gravity model and add necessary rules to regulate the simulation  | add 3D capabilities | Deadline and last changes to readme |
